    "This is the idea I suggested in the meeting. In it you have two embeddings: one for the users and one for the nudge. Their models can be changed and adapted over time, as long as the embedding stays the same. The matches between users and nudges can then be ranked by distance, which can be biased to suit our needs. The best approach for learning is to do it in daily cycles, the content still changes throughout the day as user input changes and geolocation changes but the model itself does not.\n",

This final step is the most model dependent and we need to ensure fast computation. Common examples used, include gradient boosted trees and deep learning models such as Multi gate mixture of exports. Ranking can be framed as either a classification or learning to rank problem. As a classification problem, we can score candidates based on probability of click or purchase. Logistic regression with crossed features is simple to implement and a difficult baseline to beat. Decision trees are also commonly used. As a learning to rank problem, commonly used algorithms include LambdaMart, XGBoost, and LightGBM.\n",

The advantages of this approach test on its adaptability to user flows, but this can be accounted for with adaptive recommendation.
